Integrated a couple of patches into minisat-220.tar.gz in order to increase compatibilty. 
The additional patches/commits can be retraced here: https://github.com/Udopia/minisat/.

This is MiniSAT Version 2.2.0, directly obtained from 'github' on December 19, 2014.
Then I have just unpacked the 'minisat-master.zip' file renamed the directory to
'minisat-220' to match the 'picosat' package name format and produced a
GNU zipped tar file 'minisat-220.tar.gz'.  Then I copied the makefile from
'picosat960/makefile', adapted it and provided glue code.  For MiniSAT we
need to 'libz-dev' installed.  This library dependency is specified in 'LIBS'.
Since all is C++ code, we also need to use 'g++' for linking, thus 'LINK'
contains 'g++'.
